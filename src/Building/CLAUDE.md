# Building Module

Construction, zones, areas, and shape-based multi-cell placement.

## File Groups

**Architect Menu** - `ArchitectState.cs`, `ArchitectTreeState.cs`, `ArchitectHelper.cs`, `ArchitectMenuPatch.cs`, `ArchitectPlacementPatch.cs`
Category/tool selection with treeview navigation. ArchitectState tracks mode (Category/Tool/Material/Placement).

**Shape Placement** - `ShapePlacementState.cs`, `ShapeHelper.cs`, `ShapePreviewHelper.cs`, `ShapeSelectionMenuState.cs`
Two-point placement workflow (Line, Rectangle, Oval). ShapeHelper wraps RimWorld's DrawStyle classes.

**Zones** - `ZoneCreationState.cs`, `ZoneCreationPatch.cs`, `ZoneUndoTracker.cs`, `ZoneRenameState.cs`
Zone create/expand/shrink with undo. Uses ShapePreviewHelper for shape selection.

**Plans** - `PlanColorHelper.cs`, `PlanActionHelper.cs`, `PlanRenameState.cs`, `PlanClipboard.cs`
Colored plan markers (`Verse.Plan`). `PlanColorHelper` names the nine planning `ColorDef`s (which
ship with empty labels) and drives the accessible color picker for both the architect Plan tool and
the per-plan "change color" action. `PlanActionHelper` provides the keyboard-friendly plan gizmos
(delete + the clipboard copy) and exposes the plan's **gizmos on the G key** via
`PlanActionHelper.BuildGizmos` (wired in `Inspection/GizmoNavigationState.OpenAtCursor`).
`BuildGizmos` is driven by the plan's own `GetGizmos()` so the real, game-localized gizmos (hide,
expand, shrink, delete) flow through unchanged; it only swaps the change-color action for our picker
(the vanilla one is a label-less swatch grid), drops the mouse-bound copy tools for a keyboard
clipboard copy, and appends Rename (vanilla has no rename gizmo). `PlanRenameState` mirrors
`ZoneRenameState`. Plans
also surface on the cursor tile (TileInfoHelper), in the scanner's "Plans" category (Map module), and
via Enter for a read-only Overview. Each `Plan` is already one contiguous single-color region, so it
maps cleanly to one scanner clump. The Copy gizmo captures the plan into `PlanClipboard`; Ctrl+V on
the map pastes a duplicate at the cursor (vanilla's copy tools are mouse-coupled, so this is
self-contained).

**Areas** - `AreaPatch.cs`, `AreaPaintingState.cs`, `WindowlessAreaState.cs`
Allowed areas and home zone management.

**Color Picker** - `ColorPickerAccessibilityState.cs`, `ColorPickerAccessibilityPatch.cs`
Accessible replacement for vanilla's mouse-only `Dialog_ColorPickerBase` window (the light "change
color" gizmo's `Dialog_GlowerColorPicker`, plus `Dialog_AllowedAreaColorPicker`, which shares the
same UI). Unlike `PlanColorHelper`/`PaintColorHelper` (which intercept the designator/gizmo so the
real dialog never opens), this leaves the real vanilla window in the WindowStack — same pattern as
`SliderDialogState`/`SliderDialogPatch` for `Dialog_Slider` — and drives it entirely via reflection
on `Dialog_ColorPickerBase`'s protected members (`color`, `PickableColors`, `DefaultColor`,
`ShowDarklight`, `ForcedColorValue`, `SaveColor`). Presents Default, Darklight (if supported), and
the 54 preset swatches as a flat navigable list (Up/Down), plus step-adjustable Hue/Saturation
controls (Left/Right nudge in 15°/5% steps when focused there; brightness is fixed by the dialog
itself so no Value control is needed). Enter applies the focused swatch/preset as the working color
without closing (mirrors clicking a vanilla swatch) or activates Accept/Cancel. No
`Window.OnCancelKeyPressed`/`OnAcceptKeyPressed` patch is needed — see the design notes on
`ColorPickerAccessibilityState` for why. Wired in `UnifiedKeyboardPatch` at priority -0.212.

**Analysis** - `ObstacleDetector.cs`, `EnclosureDetector.cs`
Find obstacles blocking placement; detect rooms formed by blueprints.

**Post-Placement** - `ViewingModeState.cs`, `SelectionPreviewPatch.cs`
Review results, undo segments, navigate obstacles via ScannerState.

**Building Controls** - `BuildingComponentsHelper.cs`, `*ComponentState.cs`, `*ControlState.cs`
Toggle flickable/refuel/door/forbid settings on buildings.

**Storage Linking** - `ShelfLinkingState.cs`, `ShelfLinkingPatch.cs`, `ShelfLinkingHelper.cs`, `ShelfLinkingConfirmDialog.cs`
Link storage buildings (shelves, bookcases) together without mouse-based multi-select. Two gizmos: "Link all in room" and "Link storage manually".

## Key Entry Point

`DesignatorManagerPatch.Postfix` intercepts ALL designator selections and routes to ShapePlacementState.

## Designator Type Checking

Use ShapeHelper methods (not manual type checks):
- `IsBuildDesignator()` - Designator_Build
- `IsZoneDesignator()` - Zone hierarchy
- `IsCellsDesignator()` - Mine, etc.
- `IsDeleteDesignator()` - Zone shrink
- `IsOrderDesignator()` - Hunt, Haul, Tame

## Two-Point Selection Pattern

```csharp
var previewHelper = new ShapePreviewHelper();
previewHelper.SetCurrentShape(ShapeType.FilledRectangle);
previewHelper.SetFirstCorner(cell, "[Context]");
previewHelper.UpdatePreview(cursor);  // plays sound on count change
previewHelper.SetSecondCorner(cell, "[Context]");
var cells = previewHelper.PreviewCells;
```

### Select-All Shortcut
`Ctrl+A` in shape placement steps through nested scopes:
1. First press → current enclosure. Tries `Room.ExtentsClose` first; falls
   back to `EnclosureDetector.TryFloodFillFromCell(cursor, map)` for areas
   ringed by wall blueprints/frames; if neither resolves, jumps straight to
   step 2.
2. Second press → entire map (`map.Size` bounds).
3. Third press → no-op with an "already at maximum" announcement.

`Ctrl+Shift+A` pops the most recent step and restores the prior selection.

`ShapePlacementState` owns the step history. `CurrentCtrlAStage` records what
the most recent Ctrl+A applied (`None` / `Enclosure` / `EntireMap`), and
`PushCtrlAHistory` / `TryUndoCtrlA` / `ClearCtrlAHistory` manage the stack.
Any manual point change (`SetFirstPoint`, `SetSecondPoint`, `RemoveLastPoint`,
`ClearSelectionAndStay`, `Reset`, `Enter`) clears the history because the
stack would otherwise reference an incoherent prior state.

- Line and AngledLine shapes refuse — only rect/oval variants apply.
- Uses `ShapePlacementState.SetBothPoints` which jumps straight to `Previewing`.

## Large-Shape Placement Performance

Selecting many cells at once (e.g. whole-map rectangle) must avoid O(n²) patterns:
- `ViewingModeState` keeps `obstacleCells` as a `List<IntVec3>` but pairs it with a
  `HashSet<IntVec3> obstacleCellsSet` so dedup is O(1) — a prior List.Contains loop
  froze the game for multiple seconds on full-map chop-wood selections.
- When adding new obstacle/protected cells, do `if (obstacleCellsSet.Add(cell)) obstacleCells.Add(cell)`.
- Always clear both containers together (Enter-fresh and Reset paths).
- Removals go through the HashSet first: `if (obstacleCellsSet.Remove(cell)) obstacleCells.Remove(cell);`.

## Zone Undo Pattern

```csharp
ZoneUndoTracker.CaptureBeforeState(zone, map, isShrink);
designator.DesignateMultiCell(cells);
ZoneUndoTracker.CaptureAfterState(map);
ZoneUndoTracker.AddSegment();
```

## Storage Linking

Accessible gizmos for linking storage buildings without mouse-based multi-select.

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Manual Selection Mode)
- **Arrow Keys** - Navigate map cursor
- **Space** - Toggle storage selection at cursor
- **Enter** - Confirm and link all selected storage
- **Escape** - Cancel selection mode

### Gizmos Added to Building_Storage
1. **Link all in room (X shelves, Y bookcases)** - Only on storage in enclosed rooms. Links all compatible storage in the room.
2. **Link storage manually** - Always available. Enter selection mode to manually choose storage to link.

### Confirmation Dialog
When linking storage that's already in a different group, a confirmation dialog appears:
- **Enter** - Confirm and move items to this group
- **Escape** - Cancel

### Priority in UnifiedKeyboardPatch
- 0.26: ShelfLinkingConfirmDialog
- 0.27: ShelfLinkingState
